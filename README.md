BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Description
This project takes a textfile as input and performs some data analysis using word counting
and word extrapolation functions over it.

## Functions

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `get_total_words` | Returns total number of words. |
| `get_char_repetitions` | Returns a dictionary of found characters and their occurrences. |
| `sort_dictionary` | Creates a list of dictionaries containing the character count and sorts them by number of ocurrences. | 

## To Do:
- [ ] Add function to find _Top 5 most frequent words_
- [ ] Add a _word_finder_ function that returns the number of ocurrences of a specific word inside the text
- [ ] Remove punctuation noise (dots, commas and symbols)
